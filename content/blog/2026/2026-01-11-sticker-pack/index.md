I created a sticker pack for [Signal](https://signal.org/) for personal use. It was really fun and enjoyable to do for a few days. I used [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) to draw the stickers, and I outlined them using the Narinder Pencil, which is one of the default brushes that comes with the app.

The [instructions](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360031836512-Stickers#sticker_creator) on creating a sticker pack is simple. I avoided creating animated stickers since this was my first time doing this. My main concern turned out to be figuring out how to outline the stickers so that they would appear nicely against dark backgrounds. I figured out a lazy, "good enough" solution: I alpha locked a duplicate of the sticker's layer and then filled the layer. Then, I duplicated the filled layer several times. This results in a rough, thin white outline so that at least the lineart is quite visible, which was good enough for me. Obviously, if I wanted to do a more professional job, I would outline the stickers by hand, but I wanted to push these out quickly. Though the cool part about Signal is that if you send anyone a sticker, they will be able to download the sticker pack!

Below are a few of the stickers!

I wonder if using Microsoft Paint-like brushes would make this workaround look nice... I will certainly update this if that is the case. :)
