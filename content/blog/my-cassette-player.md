Around the time I bought my MP3 music player, I also bought a cassette player. I got the [Retrospekt CP-81](https://retrospekt.com/products/retrospekt-cp-81-portable-cassette-player) because I wanted something of respectable build quality. I will eventually get a Sony Walkman though! They seem so cool.

The first cassette tape I bought was the original sountrack to the video game [*A Short Hike*](https://ashorthike.com/), one of my favorite video games. This was a game that highlighted experience over the story itself. It was really nice to just exist in the game. I'm not sure how else to put it. I'll probably flesh out my thoughts on the game properly later! (And it would be fitting to do so in the mountains.)

Oh, and the OST is amazing. I get a lot of work done with it.

I found opening the cassette player to put in a cassette super confusing at first. I've never had one growing up. All I had to do was pop open the player door when I thought there would be some sort of clicking mechanism. Nope, all magnets!

The player takes two AA batteries (yes, the batteries are included). It also has a USB Type-C port for power. It also comes with the [Koss x Retrospekt P/21 Headphones](https://retrospekt.com/collections/best-sellers/products/koss-p-21-retro-foam-on-ear-headphones). The headphones are quite neat, but my hair sometimes gets caught in them.

I'm no audiophile, but just like my MP3 player, I love the music listening experience. The buttons are tactile and so is switching out the casettes themselves. It feels nice to *own* a piece of music.
