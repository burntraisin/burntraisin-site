The video game is a form of storytelling and interactive art that involves and commands attention from many domains: our sight, our hearing, and our senses. Its elements, music, storytelling, illustration, and programming, are not as immersive alone. Video games orchestrate these elements together that allow for self-discovery and experiences.

For me, that realization came with playing *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.* I remember the distinct pull and immersion I felt while playing. It was summer during my grade school years and I was sat just outside of a work cubicle, playing on a rollable, mounted TV next to some refreshments. I was absolutely terrible at the game. I couldn't even progress past getting the paraglider to unlock the rest of the map, but I remember feeling amazed with just how *one* I felt with Link.

The art, the music, and the gameplay reeled me in. I *loved* the art style and the soundtrack. The colors were pleasing to the eye. The sound effects of Link walking and swimming were satisfying and soothing to listen to. The soundtrack contributed to the story of the game incredibly well. It made me feel alone and at peace at the same time, which was probably what Link felt. It was incredibly nice to just walk in the game and appreciate the landscape until a Guardian would throw me into a panic.

Did I ever finish the game? No, I didn't, but that's a story for another time. I think video games are underrated in the sense that they're overlooked in comparison to other media, such as books, movies, and music. Video games deserve to be taken seriously. Because they are so widespread, they are just as impactful as the music and literature we consume on the regular.
