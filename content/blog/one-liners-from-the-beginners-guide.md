I recently got around to playing the video game *The Beginner's Guide*. I bought a couple of games on Steam earlier in the spring and never got around to playing them until now. I went into the game blind, not really knowing what it was about. This isn't a game review, but I wanted to share some one-liners from the game I thought were pretty great. So, if you haven't played the game yet, please don't read ahead! It'll probably spoil a little bit of the experience for you.

> "If your role here is to not understand, then, what is it?" (Narrator)

> "I could get to know you through your work." (Narrator)

> I was going to say that it occurs to me that one's house is a lot like one's soul. You take care of it, and it takes care of you. Heh. Don't know why I felt so weird about saying that. (Game)

> Whatever work you do, you have absolutely got to own it. Otherwise, it owns you. So why don't we be with the task at hand and leave the future chores to future you. (Game)

> "I don't know this person." (Narrator)

> If there was an answer, a meaning, would it make you any happier? (Game)

> Would you simply let them be what they are? (Game)
