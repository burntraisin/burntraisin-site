# Now

As of December 24, 2025, I'm...

- done with my fall semester,
- preparing for the spring semester (and hoping I get accepted into the School of Engineering),
- applying to internships,
- working,
- hitting the gym consistently-ish,
- working on *the* research project ([EVC](https://burntraisin.github.io/burntraisin-site/work/2025-summer-assistant/)),
- and writing up more blog posts.
