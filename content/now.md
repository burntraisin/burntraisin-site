# Now

As of January 18, 2026, I'm...

- now an electrical engineering student (yippee!!),
- applying to internships,
- working,
- hitting the gym consistently-ish,
- working on *the* research project ([EVC](https://burntraisin.github.io/burntraisin-site/work/2025-summer-assistant/)),
- and writing up more blog posts.
