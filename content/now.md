# Now

As of November 4, 2025, I'm...

- trying to survive my classes (and as a result, reconfiguring how I take notes),
- working,
- hitting the gym consistently-ish,
- working on *the* research project ([EVC](https://burntraisin.github.io/burntraisin-site/work/2025-summer-assistant/)),
- and writing up more blog posts (they're coming...).
