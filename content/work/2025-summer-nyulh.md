# Medical Center IT (MCIT) Intern

Over the summer of 2025, I had the opportunity to work as an MCIT intern at NYU Langone Health in an 8-week internship. I was part of a cross-functional team that oversaw MyWall, which is a patient-facing technology solution that consists of a tablet and a TV. Patients are able to order food, call family, and watch movies.

I was a part of a few projects, the main ones being an (1) inventory tracker, (2) ticket analysis, and (3) inpatient gaming for Child Life Services. (1) I joined the team following a hardware expansion and refresh project, so there was a need for an inventory tracker to account for location and setup configuration. (2) Post-upgrade, I took a look at analyzing the resolved tickets regarding issues with MyWall. I was able to identify problem and resolution codes and develop a template to help streamline the resolution process. (3) As for inpatient gaming, I had the opportunity to help deploy Nintendo Switches for the pediatric section of the hospital.

I especially enjoyed the more hands-on aspect of my job by going over to the hospital to help troubleshoot and verify some installations following the upgrade. This was my first job in New York City, and I now understand how draining the commute can be. Despite this, I enjoyed dressing up and getting the experience of being in a formal environment. This was also my first hybrid job! Interestingly, I found that I preferred going in-person over being remote. I prefer being on my feet more than sitting at home, I think.

A significant takeaway was learning about the Agile methodology, especially with regards to collaboration and iteration. Routinely checking-in with people and setting clear deliverables made it enjoyable for me, as someone who prefers systems and routines.
